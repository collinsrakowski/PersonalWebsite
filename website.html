    <p>Hello! My name is Collins Rakowski and I am currently attending the University of Georgia as an Undergraduate with an intended major in Computer Systems Engineering. As of right now, I plan to pursue a concentration in Machine Learning.
        I am a persistent, diligent, and hardworking student with a drive to push through tasks and put in the time to get projects completed.
         On the side, I am an intramural champion and participant in multiple sports at my school, and I am in the UGA Robotics club. We are currently building a drone!</p>
